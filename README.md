# MLS Optimization

## About

**MLS (Maximum Latency Suppression)** was created with the goal of helping users optimize the performance of their PCs, especially in situations where the machine may not be very powerful or when it's necessary to run heavier games or programs. As a user of a low-spec PC, I was always looking for ways to improve my system's performance. After a lot of effort and research, I decided to create MLS, which offers a range of options and tweaks to help improve your computer's performance.

MLS provides various features to customize the system according to your needs and enhance your experience with resource-demanding games and applications.


## Development

This project was developed in **27 hours** of intense programming. During this time, the goal was to create a practical and accessible solution for all types of users, helping both those with weaker PCs and those looking to enhance the performance of more powerful machines.

## Contact

If you encounter any **bugs** or have **suggestions for improvements**, please reach out to me via email at:  
**enrcscontact@gmail.com**. Iâ€™m always available to fix issues and improve MLS.
